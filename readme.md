# Last.fm now-playing
A simple last-fm to text file (and image) tool

## Â¿Why?
obs-currentsong only supports spotify with the title and i don't want a window on obs

## How to use:
First, clone this repository and create a ``.env`` file, make sure it includes the following:
```
LASTFM_APIKEY= Your last.fm API key (create in https://www.last.fm/api/account/create)
LASTFM_USER= Your last.fm username
```
Then, you install the requirements (``pip install -r requirements.txt``), and you run it
It (hopefully) should work!

please make an issue (or send me a message on a platform or something like that) in case anything goes wrong!!
